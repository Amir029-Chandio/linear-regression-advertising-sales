# Linear Regression: Advertising vs Sales

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict **sales** based on **advertising spend**. This is part of my Data Science internship with **Coding Samurai**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Can we predict how much sales will be generated by a given advertising budget?

## 📊 Dataset
- Columns: TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales
- Source: Sample Advertising Dataset (CSV)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Correlation Analysis
4. Building Linear Regression Model
5. Model Evaluation (R² Score, MAE, RMSE)

## 📈 Output
- Graphs of regression line
- Actual vs Predicted Sales comparison
